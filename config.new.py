this will be the new config file. 
Im leaving the old one as config.old.py for reference
It will work identically to the old one, but hopefully rewriting the code
will allow us to add the features we need, remove the ones we dont
and understand the code better.
The config will be used for initialization variables and things that changes to
shouldnt get carried over from instance to instance
The settings database will be for things that changes to should get carried over
from instance to instance
this is really just a placeholder until we get actual code in here.
