    This decorator can be used multiple times to add more rules.

    Args:
        value: A regular expression which will trigger the function.

    If the Willie instance is in a channel, or sent a PRIVMSG, where a string
    matching this expression is said, the function will execute. Note that
    captured groups here will be retrievable through the Trigger object later.

    Inside the regular expression, some special directives can be used. $nick
    will be replaced with the nick of the bot and , or :, and $nickname will be
    replaced with the nick of the bot.

    Prior to 3.1, rules could also be made one of three formats of tuple. The
    values would be joined together to form a singular regular expression.
    However, these kinds of rules add no functionality over simple regular
    expressions, and are considered deprecated in 3.1.

    1 through 4, seperated by whitespace, will be groups 3-6.

    Args:
        command: A string, which can be a regular expression.

    Returns:
        A function with a new regular expression appended to the rule
        attribute. If there is no rule attribute, it is added.

    Example:
        @command("hello"):
