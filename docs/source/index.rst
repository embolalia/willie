   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Introduction
============

This package contains a framework for an easily set-up, multi-purpose IRC bot.
The intent with this package is not that it be included with other packages,
but rather be run as a standalone program. However, it is intended (and
encouraged) that users write new "modules" for it. This documentation is
intended to serve that goal.

Due to the high level of customization encouraged by this bot, there are a few
different versions of it floating around. For this documentation, we will cover
three: the original "phenny" by Sean B. Palmer the "jenni" fork by Michael
Yanovich, and the "Willie" fork by Edward Powell et al. While all receive
periodic updates, the above lists them in a generally ascending order of
recentness.

For clarity's sake, this documentation will refer to these forks as different
"API levels" or "API versions". The original phenny fork will be termed *1.x*,
the jenni fork will be termed *2.x*, and Willie, which this guide will focus
on, will be termed *3.x*.

Getting started: Your functions, ``willie``, and ``line``
=========================================================

At its most basic, writing a Willie module involves creating a Python file with
some number of functions in it. Each of these functions will be passed a 
``Willie`` object (``Phenny`` in *1.x* and ``Jenni`` in *2.x*) and a ``Trigger``
object (``CommandInput`` in *1.x* and *2.x*). By convention, these are named
``phenny`` and ``input`` in *1.x*, ``jenni`` and ``input`` in *2.x*, and
``willie`` and ``trigger`` in *3.x*. For the purposes of this guide, the *3.x*
names will be used.

Your modules
------------

A Willie module contains one or more ``callable``\s. It may optionally contain a
``configure`` or ``setup`` function. ``callable``\s are given a number of
attributes, which determine when they will be executed. Syntactically, this is
done at the same indentation level as the function's ``def`` line, following the
last line of the function.

.. py:method:: callable(willie, trigger)

    This is the general function format, called by Willie when a command is used,
    a rule is matched, or an event is seen, as determined by the attributes of
    the function. The details of what this function does are entirely up to the
    module writer - the only hard requirement from the bot is that it be callable
    with a ``Willie`` object and a ``Trigger`` object , as noted above. Usually,
    methods of the Willie object will be used in reply to the trigger, but this
    isn't a requirement.

    The return value of a callable will usually be ``None``. This doesn't need
    to be explicit; if the function has no ``return`` statement (or simply
    uses ``return`` with no arguments), ``None`` will be returned. In *3.2+*,
    the return value can be a constant defined by the ``Willie`` class; in prior
    versions return values were ignored. Returning a constant instructs the bot
    to perform some action after the ``callable``'s execution. For example,
    returning ``NOLIMIT`` will suspend rate limiting on that call.
    
    Note that the name can, and should, be anything - it doesn't need to be called
    callable.

    .. py:attribute:: commands
    
        A list of commands which will trigger the function. If the Willie instance
        is in a channel, or sent a PRIVMSG, where one of these strings is said,
        preceeded only by the configured prefix (a period, by default), the
        function will execute.
    
    .. py:attribute:: rule
    
        A regular expression which will trigger the function. If the Willie
        instance is in a channel, or sent a PRIVMSG, where a string matching this
        expression is said, the function will execute. Note that captured groups
        here will be retrievable through the ``Trigger`` object later.
        
        Inside the regular expression, some special directives can be used. ``$nick`` will be replaced with the nick of the bot and ``,`` or ``:``, and ``$nickname`` will be replaced with the nick of the bot.

        Prior to *3.1*, rules could also be made one of three formats of tuple.
        The values would be joined together to form a singular regular expression.
        However, these kinds of rules add no functionality over simple regular
        expressions, and are considered deprecated in *3.1*.

    .. py:attribute:: event
    
        This is one of a number of events, such as ``'JOIN'``, ``'PART'``,
        ``'QUIT'``, etc. (More details can be found in `RFC 1459`_.) When the Willie
        bot is sent one of these events, the function will execute. Note that
        functions with an event must also be given a ``rule`` to match (though
        it may be ``'.*'``, which will always match) or they will not be triggered.
        
        .. _RFC 1459: http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/rfc/rfc.html

    .. py:attribute:: rate
    
        *Availability: 2+*
        
        This limits the frequency with which a single user may use the function.
        If a function is given a ``rate`` of ``20``, a single user may only use
        that function once every 20 seconds. This limit applies to each user
        individually. Users on the ``admin`` list in Willie's configuration are
        exempted from rate limits.
        
    .. py:attribute:: priority
    
        Priority can be one of ``high``, ``medium``, ``low``. It allows you to
        control the order of callable execution, if your module needs it. Defaults to ``medium``

.. py:method:: setup(willie)

    This is an optional function of a module, which will be called while the
    module is being loaded. Note that this normally occurs prior to connection
    to the server, so the behavior of the Willie object's messaging functions is
    undefined. The purpose of this function is to perform whatever actions are
    needed to allow a module to function properly (e.g, ensuring that the
    appropriate configuration variables are set and exist).
    
    The bot will not continue loading modules or connecting during the execution
    of this function. As such, an infinite loop (such as an unthreaded polling
    loop) will cause the bot to hang.

.. py:method:: configure(config)

    *Availability: 3+*

    This is an optional function of a module, which will be called during the
    user's setup of the bot. It's intended purpose is to use the methods of the
    passed ``Config`` object in order to create the configuration variables it
    needs to function properly.

    In *3.1+*, the docstring of this function can be used to document the
    configuration variables that the module uses. This is not currently used
    by the bot itself; it is merely convention.

The ``Willie`` class
--------------------

.. autoclass:: willie.bot.Willie
    :members:
    
    .. py:function:: reply(text)
    
        In a module function, send ``text`` to the channel in which the function
        was triggered, preceeded by the nick of the user who triggered it.
        
        This function is not available outside of module functions. It can not
        be used, for example, in a module's ``setup`` function.
        
        The same behavior regarding loop detection and length restrictions apply
        to ``reply`` as to ``msg``.
    
    .. py:function:: say(text)
    
        In a module function, send ``text`` to the channel in which the function
        was triggered.
        
        This function is not available outside of module functions. It can not
        be used, for example, in a module's ``configure`` function.

        The same behavior regarding loop detection and length restrictions apply
        to ``say`` as to ``msg`` and ``action``.
        
    .. py:function:: action(text)
    
        In a module function, send ``text`` to the channel in which the function
        was triggered preceeded by CTCP ACTION directive (result identical to using /me in most clients).
        
        This function is not available outside of module functions. It can not
        be used, for example, in a module's ``configure`` function.

        The same behavior regarding loop detection and length restrictions apply
        to ``action`` as to ``msg`` and ``say``.

    .. py:function:: quit(message)
    
        Gracefully quit and shutdown, using ``message`` as the quit message
        
    .. py:function:: part(channel)
    
        Part ``channel``

    .. py:function:: join(channel, password = None)
    
        Join a channel named ``channel``.

    .. py:attribute:: nick
    
        Willie's current nick. Changing this while Willie is running is unsupported.
    
    .. py:attribute:: name
    
        Willie's "real name", as used for whois.
    
    .. py:attribute:: password
    
        Willie's NickServ password
    
    .. py:attribute:: channels
    
        A list of Willie's initial channels. This list will initially be the same
        as the one given in the config file, but is not guaranteed to be kept 
        up-to-date.
    
    .. py:attribute:: ops 
    .. py:attribute:: halfplus
    
        *Availability: 3+*
        
        Dictionary mapping channels to a list of their ops, and half-ops and ops
        respectively.
    
    .. py:function:: write(args, text=None)
    
        Send a command to the server. In the simplest case, ``args`` is a list
        containing just the command you wish to send, and ``text`` the argument
        to that command {e.g. write(['JOIN'], '#channel')}
        
        More specifically, ``args`` will be joined together, separated by a
        space. If text is given, it will be added preceeded by a space and a 
        colon (' :').
        
        Newlines and carriage returns ('\\n' and '\\r') are removed before
        sending. Additionally, if the joined ``args`` and ``text`` are more than
        510 characters, any remaining characters will not be sent.
    
    .. py:function:: msg(recipient, text)
    
        Send a PRIVMSG of ``text`` to ``recipient``. If the same ``text`` was
        the message in 5 or more of the last 8 calls to ``msg``, ``'...'`` will
        be sent instead. If this condition is met, and ``'...'`` is more than 3
        of the last 8 calls, no message will be sent. This is intended to prevent
        Willie from being caught in an infinite loop with another bot, or being
        used to spam.
        
        After loop detection, the message is checked for length. If the sum of
        the lengths of ``text`` and ``recipient`` are greater than 500, ``text``
        will be truncated to fit this limit.
    
    .. py:function:: debug(tag, text, level)
    
        *Availability: 3+*
        
        Send ``text`` to Willie's configured ``debug_target``. This can be either
        an IRC channel (starting with ``#``) or ``stdio``. Suppress the message
        if the given ``level`` is lower than Willie's configured ``verbose``
        setting. Acceptable values for ``level`` are ``'verbose'`` (only send if
        Willie is in verbose mode), ``'warning'`` (send if Willie is in verbose
        or warning mode), ``always`` (send debug message regardless of the configured debug level).
        Returns True if the message is sent or printed, and False if it
        is not.
        
        If ``debug_target`` is a channel, the same behavior regarding loop
        detection and length restrictions apply to ``debug`` as to ``msg``.
    
    .. py:function:: add_op(channel, name)
    .. py:function:: add_halfop(channel, name)
    
        *Availability: 3+*

        Add ``name`` to ``channel``'s entry in the ``ops`` or ``halfplus``
        dictionaries, respectively.
    
    .. py:function:: del_op(channel, name)
    .. py:function:: del_halfop(channel, name)
    
        *Availability: 3+*
        
        Remove ``name`` from ``channel``'s entry in the ``ops`` or ``halfplus``
        dictionaries, respectively.
    
    .. py:function:: flush_ops(channel)
        
        *Availability: 3+*
        
        Re-initialize  and empty the ``ops`` and ``halfops`` entry for
        ``channel``.
    
    .. py:function:: init_ops_list(self, channel)
    
        *Availability: 3+*
        
        Create an empty entry in ``ops`` and ``halfops`` for ``channel``. This
        will not damage existing entries, but must be done before users can be
        added to either dictionary.
